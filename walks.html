			<h1>Trips I've been on</h1>
			<h2>Perrys Lookdown to Acacia Flats</h2>
			<p>I went on an overnight camp in the blue mountians on my own from Perry's lookdown carpark to <a href="https://www.nationalparks.nsw.gov.au/camping-and-accommodation/campgrounds/acacia-flat-campground">Acacia Flat's campground</a>. On the NSW national parks <a href="https://www.nationalparks.nsw.gov.au/things-to-do/walking-tracks/perrys-lookdown-to-blue-gum-forest-walking-track">website</a> it says the walk is only 2km, so I was expecting a pretty cruisy walk (and because of this, like an idiot, I started at 4pm at the peak of winter) however it was anything but.</p>
			<h2>Vietnam and Thailand</h2>
			<p>My <a href="https://www.instagram.com/lilahrrose">girlfriend</a> and I on a trip to vietnam and thailand from late 2019 to early 2020 (thankfully just before covid hit). We were away for 6 weeks, with about 3 of those travelling from Ho Chi Minh to Hanoi, 1 in Chiang Mai, 1 on Koh Lanta and the remaing week bouncing around Krabi, Bangkok and Koh Samui.</p>
